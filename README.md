Stock Quotes paginated table.


About the project:

React & Redux web application that shows the most relevant stock quote information up-to-date. It uses https://iexcloud.io/ API, to retrieve data about current stock market, and displays it in a neat table structure. It also uses https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd React beautiful drag and drop API to restructure the order of datas. I used HTML Tables to struture my data in a table. As well as Redux toolit and Redux Thunk for the future expands of the project.


I faced several challanges upon bulding this project. The bigges must be the Redux toolkit. Whole new language I have only heard here and there, that is usufull for state management throught the app. It had a lot of boiler plates which made whole process more challenging. 


Technologies used: React, Redux, Redux Thunk, IEX Cloud APi, react-beautiful-dnd API, youtube, google.
